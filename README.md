### CLI Commands in runtime

Also, at playback you can use some commands to control playback
``c``/``exit`` - closes program

``p`` - play/pause

``next`` - next track

``vol [number: float]`` - sets volume (default: 1.0) CAUTION: values above 1.0 causes a serious clipping, also - negative values inverts track phase

``seek [serconds: number]`` - sets track position (in seconds)

``switchadvanced`` - switches to new playback system (enabled by default) thats playback system fast but can have short-time memory peaks around 150-180 mb

``switchsimple`` - switch to old-patched playback system this playback system is clean in terms of memory but may have some perfomance issues

## Building
1. [Download Rust]([https://www.rust-lang.org/learn/get-started) and run this command
2. ```git clone https://github.com/LaineZ/bc_rs.git```
3. ```cd bc_rs```
4. If you run on Linux you need install these audio libs: ``libaudio`` and ``libasound2``
   1. On Ubuntu you can just run that command ``sudo apt install libaudio-dev libasound2-dev``
5. ```cargo build``` also you can add ``--release`` option to reduce binary file size and speed up tracks operations
